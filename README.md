# AI Bootcamp - Linear Regression

A fully interactive teaching website covering Linear Regression end-to-end. Built for live teaching sessions with clean, minimal design and no visual clutter.

## Purpose

This platform was created to teach machine learning fundamentals through hands-on visualization. Instead of just reading formulas, learners can interact with the concepts directly - adding data points, watching gradient descent converge, and seeing how outliers affect regression in real-time.

## Features

- Interactive regression visualizer with click-to-add points
- Live metrics display (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R-squared)
- Animated gradient descent training simulator
- 3D cost surface visualization
- Multiple regression with interactive 3D plane
- Outlier effect demonstration
- Normal equation calculator
- Regularization preview (L1/L2)
- Dark and light mode support

## Topics Covered

1. Problem Definition and Basics
2. Mathematical Formulation
3. Cost and Loss Functions
4. Optimization (Gradient Descent)
5. Performance Metrics
6. Interactive Regression Plot
7. Outliers and Their Effect
8. Training Visualization
9. Multiple Regression
10. Normal Equation
11. Regularization Preview
